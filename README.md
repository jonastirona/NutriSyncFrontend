# Nutrisync Frontend 🥗

Nutrisync is an app dedicated to people trying to improve their fitness and diet habits. Nutrisync allows its users to track their diet throughout the day by letting users log food they ate while automatically keeping track of the calories and macronutrients accumulated. Users have multiple ways of logging their food including searching up food items, scanning food barcodes, or by manually typing in food macros.

This repository is dedicated to the frontend of the product, responsible for the user interface and interactions with the backend services.
