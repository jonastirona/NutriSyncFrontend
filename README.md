# Nutrisync Frontend 🥗

Nutrisync is an app dedicated to people trying to improve their fitness and diet habits. Nutrisync allows its users to track their diet throughout the day by letting users log food they ate while automatically keeping track of the calories and macronutrients accumulated. Users have multiple ways of logging their food including searching up food items, scanning food barcodes, or by manually typing in food macros.

This repository is dedicated to the frontend of the product, responsible for the user interface and interactions with the backend services.

## Installation and Setup Instructions ⚙️

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jonastirona/NutrisyncFrontend.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd nutrisyncFrontend
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Usage 📲
- Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device.
- Scan the QR code generated by the development server to run the app on your device.
- Note: The Expo Go app cannot run the scanner page because it requires camera access. To use the scanner functionality, you will need to run the app natively on your device using `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android`.
